Simple react game based on Pluralsight's Samer Buna ReactJS course

## Game Play

Each turn, you get a random number of stars. Select number or numbers that equal to number of stars. Then click the equal button. If you chose correctly, click again and submit your answer. You can deselect numbers by clicking on them.

The goal of this game is to use each number only once during the game and not run out of number options.

If you have no options left, you can get another set of stars by clicking orange button (5 times per game).

**Good luck!**
